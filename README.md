# SORTa Helpful

SORTa Helpful is an iOS application developed by Omar Valenzuela (ovalenzu@uci.edu) and Brandon Teran (bteran@uci.edu) to help students learn, visualize, and master their knowledge on various sorting algorithms.

Created in the time span of about ~5 weeks, SORTa Helpful is an ongoing project that will be going under continuous development to improve user friendliness and to include different types of algorithms (such as shortest-path algorithms, graph traversals, etc...).

Our goal is to help students solidify their knowledge on important everyday used sorting algorithms as well as provide the foundation for students to go above and beyond and learn other various less-used algoirthms such as Bogo sort, Sleep sort, and Cocktail Sort (for fun).
